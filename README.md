Hello World! 
I'm Bolaji John Onunwa a Nigerian, currently I'm a Junior Software Engineer in Nigeria, passionate about solving problems with technology and creating different solutions.

I was formally a Marketer as I studied Marketing in my first degree this empowered me with the art of negotiation and selling anything. I have always had an undying passion for computers since the first day I set my eyes on one, I became a passionate biker after I discovered it is the best means of transportation for me. I talk about technology, programming, soft skills, career challenges, tips and more. I always try to help people and make friends out of them as much as possible, because I strongly believe that "Good friends are like medicaine". 👨‍💻 🚀

🏡 I love being with my family and friends, they are everything to me.
✈️ I love to travel and get to know new places and cultures.
⚽ Passionate about sport bikes and adventure bikes. 🔴⚫️⚪️
